# 🛡️ Guardian for Bikers

Guardian for Bikers is a bot designed to help protect bikers from bad weather.

To make rides even more engaging, there's a points system: every time you go out, you earn points. At the end of each day, a leaderboard is shown and the ultimate goal 🎯 is to finish the year in first place.

# Setup
A Docker Compose setup is provided for quick and easy deployment with pre-configured values.

> WARNING: You only need to manually insert the tokens for the bot and the weather API.

# Which weather service do I use? ⛅

This project uses the [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) weather service.
